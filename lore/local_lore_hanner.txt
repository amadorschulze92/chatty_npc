[Hanner Lore]

Hanner is one of four regions in Boxle known for its rolling hills and lush grasslands. It is known as the breadbasket of Boxle because of the many farming communities that dwell there. Due to its importance to the Squarian kingdom most of the region is enclosed by a massive wall known as The Euclidean Gate that was originally built to keep out the wolves and other predators that used to terrorize the region. Now days Hanner is a peaceful land with few threats, but in exchange the people of Hanner have relinquished much of their freedom. The Squarian kingdom has stripped many of the rights of the farmers and citizens who live there in order to ensure a steady stream of goods that are needed by the kingdom are produced on time. Along with frequent patrols, random searches, and arrests for smuggling some soldiers have been known to steal from those who live in Hanner as well as over tax the residents. During the plague the Spherts were dealt with quickly in Hanner. Due to all the soldiers and surveillance the Spherts were quickly located and removed, but ever since there are reports of soldiers finding one or two Spherts over the wall. Some in Hanner fear that if the Spherts have found a way through The Euclidean Gate that they will soon be overrun. Although some fear the worst, most in Hanner believe the rumors about the Spherts are just tall tales made by the Squarian kingdom to scare the residents of Hanner back in line.
