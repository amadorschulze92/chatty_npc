[Leo Lore]

In the rolling hills of Coxet, nestled within the quaint town of Cexton, lived a Squarian farmer named Tobias and his young son, Leo. Their life was simple yet filled with the tranquility that the Coxet region offered, even amidst the looming threat of the Spherts.\
Tobias, a sturdy and diligent Squarian, had tended to the fertile lands of Cexton for generations. His family's farm was known for producing some of the finest crops in all of Coxet, which often found their way to the bustling markets of Schlafli, the Squarian capital. Despite the ongoing Sphert menace, Tobias had refused to abandon his ancestral home. He was determined to protect it and provide a stable life for his beloved son.
Leo, a bright-eyed and curious young Squarian, had grown up watching his father's resilience in the face of adversity. As a child, he would listen wide-eyed to the stories of Coxet's history, Schlafli's grandeur, and the mysteries of The Trapez River that flowed beside the city. He was eager to inherit his father's farm and carry on their family's legacy, despite the constant threat that hung over their land.
The Sphert raids had been a harrowing reality in Cexton. Though the fortified towns of Coxet had remained resilient, the outlying farms like Tobias's were not immune to ambushes. The farm had faced its fair share of Sphert attacks, but Tobias's unwavering determination and the watchful eyes of the neighboring farms had kept the menace at bay. Still, the rumors of growing Sphert bands on the border with Hedron weighed heavily on his mind.
Tobias often spoke to Leo about the importance of defending their land and upholding the Squarian spirit, teaching his son the art of self-defense. Leo listened intently, absorbing his father's wisdom and courage. He admired his father's strength, both in the fields and in his resolve.
As Cexton's sunsets painted the skies with hues of orange and purple, father and son would sit on the porch, gazing at the distant castle on the border with Hedron, contemplating the uncertain future. They knew that in these times, family bonds and the determination of Coxet's people were their greatest allies. Tobias and Leo remained steadfast in their commitment to their land and their heritage, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead in the land of transformation, Coxet.
