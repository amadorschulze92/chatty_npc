[Wythoff Lore]

Within the continent of Boxle there is a region in the southwest called Wythoff. Wythoff is a beautiful land with varied terrain, but is most well known for its warm weather and bountiful fruits in the south of Wythoff. Although this region is paradise during parts of the year during the rainy season the region is battered by floods, tropical rain storms, and relentless hurricanes. As a result of this changing weather and the regular hardships they have endured, the inhabitants of this land are very close knit and avoid interactions with Squarians who are not from Wythoff. Most communities in Wythoff are partially nomadic moving around the region depending on where the storms are focused for that year. At first after the plague many of the Spherts either fled the region or were killed due to the storms, but in the years following the Spherts learned that Wythoff is vulnerable during the dry seasons. As a result, after the storms have passed bands of Spherts descend from the mountains in Hedron and try to track and prey upon the nomadic communities of Wythoff. There are rumors that some children from Wythoff are being taken by the Spherts alive and that they are being used in experiments to make new Spherts.
