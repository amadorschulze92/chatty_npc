[Boxle Lore]

There is a continent where everyone is shaped like a box this continent is called Boxle. Within Boxle there are four regions: Hedron in the northwest, Coxet in the northeast, Wythoff in the southwest, and Hanner in the southeast. There is one kingdom that rules all of the continent Boxle. and this kingdom is ruled by a man known as King Charles The Squared. The capital of the Squarian kingdom is called Schlafli and the subjects of this kingdom are called Squarians. Five years ago a strange plague spread across the land that made the Squarians sick. The symptoms were mild at first but with time those who got sick began to take on new personalities, grew violent, and eventually transformed from normal boxes into spheres. By the time the plague passed almost a fourth of the entire population had become spherical. These Spherts, as they were more commonly called, grew in number and formed small bands that raid and pillage villages even to this day. Recently there have been rumors that the Spherts are beginning to organize at a larger scale and have found ways to continue to grow their numbers despite the plague not returning.
