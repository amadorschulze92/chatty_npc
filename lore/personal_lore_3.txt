[Ethan Lore]

In the rolling hills and lush grasslands of Hanner, where the fields stretched as far as the eye could see, there lived a young Squarian named Ethan. Born into a family of blacksmiths, the art of forging had been passed down through generations in their quiet farming community.
Ethan had always felt a deep connection to the anvil and the forge. From a young age, he would watch his father and grandfather work the fiery metal, their skilled hands shaping it into tools and weapons that would aid their fellow Squarians. It was a life of humble but honest craftsmanship, and Ethan embraced it with a passion that went beyond the ordinary.
As an apprentice blacksmith, Ethan learned the secrets of the trade with unwavering dedication. His days were filled with the rhythmic pounding of the hammer, the roar of the forge, and the scent of molten metal. He honed his skills under the watchful eye of his father, who instilled in him not only the techniques of the craft but also the values of integrity, hard work, and the importance of community.
Yet, as the years passed and Ethan's proficiency grew, a restlessness began to stir within him. He would sit by the village fire in the evenings, listening to the stories of traders and travelers who passed through Hanner on their way to other regions of Boxle. Their tales painted vivid pictures of far-off lands, diverse cultures, and the grandeur of Schlafli, the Squarian capital.\
Ethan's heart filled with wanderlust. He dreamed of exploring the world beyond Hanner's rolling hills, of witnessing the bustling markets of Coxet, and perhaps even visiting the enigmatic Wythoff with its warm weather and exotic fruits. The very thought of stepping beyond the walls of Hanner filled him with excitement.
However, his dreams clashed with the reality of life in Hanner. The Squarian kingdom's strict control over the region had created an atmosphere of surveillance and suppression. The Euclidean Gate, a massive wall that enclosed most of Hanner, was a constant reminder of the kingdom's authority. Random searches, arrests for smuggling, and overtaxation had become a part of daily life for the residents.\
During the plague, Hanner had acted swiftly to combat the Sphert threat. The presence of the kingdom's soldiers had ensured that the Spherts were quickly located and removed. However, there were whispers of one or two Spherts found within the region since then. Some feared that the Spherts had found a way through The Euclidean Gate, while others believed it was a mere ruse by the Squarian kingdom to maintain control.
Ethan, torn between his love for blacksmithing and his longing for adventure, faced a crucial decision. Would he stay in Hanner, continuing his family's legacy and enduring the kingdom's oppressive rule? Or would he dare to pursue his dreams, venturing into the unknown, and perhaps uncovering the truth about the world beyond the confines of his homeland?
As the rhythmic pounding of the forge continued in the background, Ethan knew that his path was his to forge, just as he had done with countless pieces of metal. The world beckoned, and his heart yearned to answer the call of adventure that echoed across the rolling hills of Hanner.
