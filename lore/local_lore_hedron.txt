[Hedron Lore]

Hedron is one of four regions on the continent of Boxle. Hedron is located in the northwest of the continent and is a cold land of mountains and dense forests. In the middle of Hedron there is a large group of mountains called the Delian range which have the largest mountains in the whole continent. The Delian range provides water that feeds many of the rivers in Boxle. For many years the were only a few small towns in Hedron that were located in the less cold parts of the region. Since the plague the Spherts have infested the land of Hedron and have driven many of the Squarians out. There are rumors that the Spherts are grouping in Hedron to create their own kingdom under an unknown leader.
