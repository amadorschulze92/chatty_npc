[Coxet Lore]

Coxet is one of four regions on the continent of Boxle. Coxet is in the northeast part of Boxle and is made up of windswept hills, deep and mysterious lochs, and a hearty people. There is a long history of people occupying Coxet and thus has some of the oldest towns as well as many well fortified castles. Coxet is also home to the capital of the Squarian kingdom which is called Schlafli. Schlafli is the center of math, science, the arts, and trade for the entire continent. There is a large river called The Trapez River that runs next to the city and is the main method of trade for the city. After the plague Spherts began ambushing Squarians traveling or trading between the fortified towns, but due to the fortified cities the Spherts were no threat to the towns and cities themselves. There are rumors that some of the castles on the border with Hedron have seen growing bands of Spherts of sizes previously never seen before. Some worry the Spherts are preparing for full out war.
